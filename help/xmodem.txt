NAME
  XMODEM -- the XMODEM command

SYNOPSIS
  XMODEM SEND file$
  XMODEM RECIEVE file$

DESCRIPTION
  The XMODEM command transfers a file to or from a
  remote computer using the XModem protocol. The
  transfer is done over the USB connection or, if
  a serial port is opened as console, over that
  serial port. "file$" is the file on the micro SD
  card or internal flash to be sent or recieved.

  The XModem protocol requires a co-operating
  software program running on the remote computer
  and connected to its serial port. It has been
  tested on Tera Term running on Windows and it is
  recommended that this be used. After running the
  XMODEM command in MMBasic select:

    FILE->Transfer->XMODEM->Recieve/Send

  from the Tera Term menu to start the transfer.
  The transfer can take up to 15 seconds to start
  if the XMODEM command fails to establish
  communications it will return to the MMBasic
  prompt after 30 seconds.
