NAME
  SPI -- the SPI function

DESCRIPTION
  The SPI(rx, tx, clk[, data[, speed]]) function
  sends and receives a byte using the SPI protocol
  with MMBasic as the master (ie it generates the
  clock).

  'rx' is the GPIO port number for the data input
  (aka MISO master-input slave-output)

  'tx' is the GPIO port number for the data output
  (aka MOSI master-output slave-input)

  'clock' is the GPIO port number for the clock
  generated by MMBasic (aka CLK) 

  'data' is optional and is an integer
  representing the data byte to send over the data
  output pin. If it is not specified the tx pin
  will be held low as if the data is 0. 

  'speed' is optional and is the speed of the
  clock. It is a single letter either H, M or L
  where H is 500KHz, M is 50KHz and L is 5KHz.
  Default is H. 

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 SETPIN 1,2 'define Rx as input
  \> 20 SETPIN 2,8 'define Tx as output
  \> 30 SETPIN 3,8 'define clock as output 
  \> 40 PRINT SPI(1,2,3,255,H) 'send FF and receive one byte
  \> RUN
  255
