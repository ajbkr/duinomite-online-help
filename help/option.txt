NAME
  OPTION -- the OPTION command

SYNOPSIS
  OPTION BASE [0|1]
  OPTION ERROR [ABORT|CONTINUE]
  OPTION PROMPT string$
  OPTION Fnn string$

DESCRIPTION
  OPTION BASE [0|1]

  Sets the lowest value for array subscripts to
  either 0 or 1. The default is 0. This must be
  used before any arrays are declared.

  OPTION ERROR [ABORT|CONTINUE]

  Sets the treatment for errors in file
  input/output. The option CONTINUE will cause
  MMBasic to ignore file related errors. 

  The program must check the variale MM.ERRNO to
  determine if and what error has occured. The
  option ABORT sets the normal behaviour (ie stop
  the program and print an error message. The
  default is ABORT. Note that this option only
  relates to errors reading or writing from the
  micro SD card, it does not affect the handling
  of syntax and other program errors.

  OPTION PROMPT string$

  Set the command prompt to the contents of
  'string$' (which can also be an expression which
  will be evaluated when the prompt is printed.)

  For Example

  OPTION PROMPT "OK"
  OPTION PROMPT TIME$ + ":"
  OPTION PROMPT CWD$ +":"

  Maximum length of the prompt string is 48
  characters. The prompt is reset to the default
  ('>') on power up but you can automatically set
  it by saving the following example program as
  "AUTORUN.BAS" on the internal flash drive A:

  10 OPTION PROMPT "My prompt:"
  20 NEW

  OPTION Fnn string$

  Sets the prgrammable function keys 'Fnn' to the
  contents of'string$' "Fnn" is the function key
  F1 to F12. Maximum string length is 12
  characters. "string$" can also be an expression
  that will be evaluated at the time of running
  the OPTION command. This is most often used to
  append the ENTER key (chr$(13)), or double quotes
  (chr$(34)).

  For Example

  OPTION F1 "RUN" + CHR$(13)
  OPTION F6 "SAVE" + CHR$(34)
  OPTION F10 "ENDIF"

  Normally these commands are included in an
  AUTORUN.BAS file (see OPTION PROMPT) for an
  example.
