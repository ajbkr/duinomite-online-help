NAME
  INSTR -- the INSTR function

SYNOPSIS
  INSTR([start-position,] string-searched$,
   string-pattern$)

DESCRIPTION
  INSTR returns the position at which
  string-pattern$ occurs in string-searched$,
  beginning at the start position.

  The optional offset [start-position] sets the
  position for starting the search. The default
  value for [start-position] is 1. If
  [start-position] equals zero, the error
  "Number out of bounds" is returned.
  [start-position] must be in the range 1 to 255.
  If [start-position] is out of this range, a
  "Number out of bounds" error is returned.

RETURN VALUES
  INSTR returns 0 if:
    - [start-position] > LEN(string-searched$)
    - [string-searched] is null
    - [string-pattern$] cannot be found

  If [string-pattern$] is "", INSTR returns
  [start-position].

  [string-searched$] and [string-pattern$] may be
  string variables, string expressions, or string
  literals.

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 X$="ABCDEBXYZ"
  \> 20 Y$="B"
  \> 30 PRINT INSTR(X$, Y$); INSTR(4, X$, Y$)
  \> RUN
  2 6

  The interpreter searches the string "ABCDFBXYZ"
  and finds the first occurrence of the character
  B at position 2 in the string. It then starts
  another search at position 4 (D) and finds the 
  second match at position 6 (B). The last three
  characters are ignored, since all conditions set
  out in line 30 were satisfied.
