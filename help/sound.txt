NAME
  SOUND -- the SOUND command

SYNOPSIS
  SOUND freq,dur
  SOUND freq,dur,duty

DESCRIPTION
  The SOUND command will generate a single tone of
  'freq' (between 20Hz to 1MHz) for 'dur'
  milliseconds. The sound is played in the
  background and does not stop program execution.

  If 'dur' is zero any active SOUND statement is
  turned off. If no SOUND statement is running, a
  'dur' of zero has no effect. 

  'duty' is the optional duty cycle of the
  waveform in percent. If it is close to zero the
  output will be a narrow positive pulse. If it is
  not specified the duty cycle will default to
  50%. Setting the duty cycle allows the sound
  output to be used as a Pulse Width Modulation
  (PWM) output for driving analog circuits.

  The signal will be avaliable at the sound
  connector and the voltage divider on this output
  should be removed so the full signal level is
  available. The frequency of the output is locked
  to the PIC32 crystal and is very accurate and
  for frequencies below 100KHz the duty cycle will
  be accurate to 0.1%.
