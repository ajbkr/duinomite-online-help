NAME
  PIN -- the PIN command

DESCRIPTION
  The PIN (pin)= value command. For a 'pin'
  configured as digital output this will set the
  output to low ("value" is zero) or high ("value"
  non zero). You can set an output high or low
  before it is configured as an output and that
  setting will be the default output when the
  SETPIN command takes effect. 

  'pin' zero is a  special case and will always
  control the green LED used for micro SD card
  accesses.

  A "value" of non zero will turn the LED on, or
  zero for off.

  See the function PIN() for reading from a pin
  and the command SETPIN for configuring it.

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 PIN(0) = 1 'Turn on green LED
  \> 20 PAUSE 500  'wait 500ms
  \> 30 PIN(0) = 0 'Turn off green LED
  \> 40 PAUSE 500  'wait 500ms
  \> 50 GOTO 10	 'and again
