NAME
  PRINT -- the PRINT command

SYNOPSIS
  PRINT expression [[,;]expression]...

DESCRIPTION
  This command outputs text to the screen.
  Multiple expressions can be used and must be
  separated by either:

    Comma (,) which will output the tab character

    Semicolon (;) which will not output anything
    (it is just used to separate expressions).

  Nothing or a space which will act the same as a
  semicolon.

  A semicolon(;) at the end of the expression list
  will surpress the automatic output of a carriage
  return/newline at the end of a print statement.

  When printed, a number is preceded with a space
  if positive or a minus(-) if negative but is not
  followed by a space. Integers (whole numbers)
  are printed without a decimal point while
  fractions are printed with the decimal point and
  significiant decimal digits. Large numbers
  (greater than six digits) are printed in
  scientific format.

  The function FORMAT$() can be used to format
  numbers. The function TAB() can be used to space
  to a certain column and the string functions can
  be used to justify or otherwise format strings.

  A single question mark (?) can be used as a
  shortcut for the PRINT keyword.

  The PRINT #nbr, expression [[,;] expression]...

  Is the same as the above command except that the
  output is directed to a file previously opened
  for OUTPUT or APPEND as "nbr".

EXAMPLE
  \> PRINT "Hello world"
  Hello world

  \> ? "Hello world"
  Hello world
