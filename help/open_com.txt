NAME
  OPEN -- the OPEN [comspec] command

SYNOPSIS
  OPEN "COMn:[speed][,buf,FC][,OC]" AS [#]fnbr

DESCRIPTION
  n is the serial port number (1 to 4);

  baud is the speed (75, 150, 300, 600, 1200,
  2400, 4800, 9600, 19200) The default is 1200 baud;

  buf is the communications buffer size in bytes.
  The default is 128.

  FC enables hardware flow control on COM1:.

  This command opens a serial port for reading and
  writing. There are 4 serial ports. COM1: and
  COM2: are bit-banged in software and are
  therefore limited to a top speed of 19200 bps,
  while COM3: and COM4: are implemented in
  hardware with a reliable top speed of 115200
  bps.

  COM1: uses GPIO pin 13 for receive data, GPIO
  pin 14 for transmit data and if flow control is
  specified GPIO pin 15 for RTS and GPIO pin 16
  for CTS.

  COM2: uses GPIO pin 17 for recieve data, GPIO
  pin 18 for transmit data

  COM3: uses UEXT pin 4 for recieve data, UEXT pin
  3 for transmit data

  COM4: uses GPIO pin 11 for recieve data, GPIO
  pin 12 for transmit data

  If the port is opened using 'fnbr' the port can
  be written to and read from using any commands
  or functions that use a file number.

  OPEN "COMn:[speed][,buf,FC][,OC]" AS CONSOLE

  A serial port can be opened with 'AS CONSOLE'.
  In this case any data recieved will be treated
  the same as keystrokes recieved from the
  keyboard and any characters sent to the video
  output will also be transmitted via the serial
  port. This enables the remote control of MMBasic
  via a serial interface.

EXAMPLES
  OPEN "COM1:" AS 1
  OPEN "COM1:2400" AS #2
  OPEN "COM1:2400" AS CONSOLE
