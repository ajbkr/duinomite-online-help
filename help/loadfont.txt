  loadfont -- loadable fonts

DESCRIPTION
  This section describes the format of a font file
  that can be loaded using the FONT LOAD command. 

  A font file is just a text file containing
  ordinary characters which are loaded line by
  line to build the bitmap of each character in
  the font. Each character can be up to 64 pixels
  high and 255 pixels wide. Up to 255 characters
  can be defined in a font. 

  The first non comment line in the file must be
  the specifications for the font as follows:  

    height, width, start, end 

  Where 'height' and 'width' are the size of each
  character in pixels, 'start' is the number in
  the ASCII chart where the first character sits
  and 'end' is the last character. Each number is
  separated by a comma. So, for example: 

    16, 11, 48, 57

  means that the font is 16 pixels high and 11
  pixelswide. The first character is decimal 48
  (the zero character) and the last is 57 (number
  nine character). 

  The remainder of the lines specify the bitmap
  for each character.  

  Each line represents a horizontal row of pixels.
  A space means the pixel is not illuminated and
  any other character will turn the pixel on.  If
  the font is 11 pixels wide there must be 11 
  characters in the line.  The first line is the
  top row of pixels in the character, the next is
  the second and so on.  If the character is 16
  pixels high there must be 16 lines to define the 
  character. This repeats until each character is
  drawn. Using the above example of a font 16x11
  with 10 characters there must be a total of 160
  lines with each line 11 characters wide. This is
  in addition to the specification line at the
  top. 

  A comment line has an apostrophe (') as the
  first character and can occur anywhere. A
  comment line is completely ignored, all other
  lines are significant. 

  The following example creates two small icons, a
  smiley face and a frowning face.  Each is 11x11
  pixels with the first (the smiley face) in the
  position of the zero character (0) and the
  frowning face in the position of number one (1).  

  To display a smiley face your program would
  contain this: 

    40 FONT LOAD "FACES.FNT" AS #6  ' load the
     font 
    50 FONT #6                      ' select the
     font 
    60 PRINT "0"                    ' print a
     smiley face 

  The font file would contains this:

    ' example 
    ' FACES.FNT 
    11,11,48,49
