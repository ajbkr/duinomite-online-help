NAME
  POKE -- the POKE command

DESCRIPTION
  The POKE hiword, loword, val command will set a
  byte within the PIC32 virtual memory space to
  'val'. "hiword" is the top 16 bits of the
  address while "loword" is the bottom 16 bits.

  THIS COMMAND IS FOR EXPERT USERS ONLY

  The PIC32 maps all control registers, flash
  (program) memory and volatile (RAM) memory into
  a single address space so there is no need for
  INP or OUT commands. The PIC32MX5XX/6XX/7XX
  family data sheet lists the details of this
  address space while the source code will provide
  the symbolic names used in the firmware and
  Maximite.map file (produced after a successful
  compile) will list addresses of these symbols.
  These addresses will change with each version of
  the firmware so programs should use the
  predefined variable MM.VER to determine the
  currently running MMBasic version.

  WARNING: If you use this facility to access an
  invalid memory address the MIPS CPU will throw
  an exception which causes the processor to reset
  and clear all memory. to see this effect try
  POKE 100,1000,100. To completely reset the CPU
  after the above POKE, you will need to cycle the
  power.
