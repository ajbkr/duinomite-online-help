NAME
  LEFT -- the LEFT function

DESCRIPTION
  The LEFT$(string$,number-of-chars) function will
  return a substring of 'string$' with
  'number-of-chars' from the left (beginning) of
  the string.

  'number-of-chars' must be within the range of 0
  to 255. If 'number-of-chars' is greater than
  LEN(x$), the entire 'string$' will be returned.
  If 'number-of-chars' equals zero, the null
  string (length zero) is returned.

SEE ALSO
  INSTR,  MID$(), RIGHT$() substring functions.
