NAME
  SPC -- the SPC function

DESCRIPTION
  The SPC(number) function returns a string of
  blank spaces 'number' bytes long.  This function
  is similar to the SPACE$() function and is only
  included for Microsoft compatibility. 

  'number' must be within the range of 0 to 255.

  If 'number' is greater than the defined width of
  the printer or the screen, the value used will
  be n MOD width.

EXAMPLE
  \> PRINT "OVER" SPC(15) "THERE"
  OVER               THERE
