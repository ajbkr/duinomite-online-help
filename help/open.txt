NAME
  OPEN -- the OPEN command

DESCRIPTION
  The OPEN fname$ FOR mode AS [#]fnbr command will
  open a file on the default drive for reading and
  writing. 'fname$' is the filename (8 chars max)
  with an optional extension (3 chars max)
  separated by a dot(.). 'mode' is INPUT or OUTPUT
  or APPEND. 

  INPUT will open the file for reading and throw
  an error if the file doesn't exist.

  OUTPUT will open the file for writing and will
  automatically overwrite any existing file with
  the same name. 

  APPEND will open the file for writing but it
  will not overwrite an existing file, instead any
  writes to the file will be appended to the end
  of the file. If there is no existing file the
  APPEND option will act the same as the OUPUT
  mode (ie the file is created then opened for
  writing). 'fnbr' is the file number (1 to 10).
  The # is optional. Up to 10 files can be open
  simultaneously. 

  The INPUT, LINE INPUT, PRINT, WRITE and CLOSE
  commands as well as the EOF() and INPUT$()
  functions all use 'fnbr' to identify the file
  being operated on.

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 OPEN "out1.txt" FOR input AS #1
  \> 20 LINE INPUT#1, A$
  \> 30 PRINT "Text: " A$
  \> 40 CLOSE#1
