NAME
  TAB -- the TAB function

DESCRIPTION
  The TAB(nbr) function outputs spaces until the
  column indicated by 'nbr' has been reached.

  If the current print position is already beyond
  column  'nbr', TAB goes to that position on the
  next line.

  Column 1 is the leftmost position. The rightmost
  position is the screen width. 'nbr' must be
  within the range of 1 to 255.

  It is as though the TAB function has an implied
  semicolon after it. TAB may be used only in
  PRINT and PRINT # statements.

EXAMPLES
  \> 10 PRINT "HELLO" TAB(3) "WORLD"
  \> RUN
  HELLO
     WORLD

  \> 10 PRINT "HELLO" TAB(10) "WORLD"
  \> RUN
  HELLO    WORLD
