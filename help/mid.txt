NAME
  MID -- the MID$ function

SYNOPSIS
  MID$(string$,start-position-in-string
   [,number-of-chars])

DESCRIPTION
  MID$ returns a substring of 'string$' beginning
  at 'start-position-in-string' and continuing for
  'number-of-chars' bytes. If 'number-of-chars' is
  omitted, the returned string will extend to the
  end of 'string$'

  'start-position-in-string' must be in the range
  1 to 255. 'number-of-chars' must be in the range
  0 to 255.

  If 'number-of-chars' is omitted, or if there are
  fewer than 'number-of-chars' characters to the
  right of 'start-position-in-string', all
  rightmost characters beginning with
  'start-position in-string' are returned.

  If [start-position-in-string] > LEN(x$), MID$
  function returns a null string.

  If [number-of-chars] equals 0, the MID$ function
  returns a null string.

  If either [start-position-in-string] or
  [number-of-chars] is out of range, a "Number out
  of bounds" error is returned.

SEE ALSO
  INSTR, LEFT$(), RIGHT$().

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 A$="GOOD"
  \> 20 B$="MORNING EVENING AFTERNOON"
  \> 30 PRINT A$; MID$(B$, 8, 8)
  \> RUN
  GOOD EVENING

  Line 30 concatenates (joins) the A$ string to
  another string with a length of 8 characters,
  beginning at position 8 within the B$ string.
