NAME
  INPUT -- the INPUT command

SYNOPSIS
  INPUT[prompt string$] variable [,variable...]

DESCRIPTION
  This command allows input from the keyboard to a
  list of variables. The input command will prompt
  with a question mark(?).

  The input must contain commas to separate the
  data for each variable if there is more than
  one. For Example, if the command is:

    INPUT a,b,c 

  and 23, 87, 66 is typed on the keyboard, then
  a=23, b=87 and c=66.

  If the optional 'prompt string$' is specified
  it will be printed before the question mark
  prompt.

  If the 'prompt string$' is terminated with a
  comma (,) rather than a semicolon (;) the
  question mark will be supressed.

  INPUT#nbr, variable [,variable...]

  This command is the same as the previous one
  except that the input is read from a file
  previously opened for INPUT as 'nbr'.

SEE ALSO
  OPEN, LINE INPUT.

EXAMPLE
  10 OPEN "OUT1.TXT" FOR input AS #1
  20 INPUT#1, A$
  30 PRINT "Text: " A$
  40 CLOSE#1
