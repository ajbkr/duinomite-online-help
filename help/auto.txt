NAME
  AUTO -- the Auto command

SYNOPSIS
  There are three ways to use the 'auto' command.

  AUTO
  AUTO startline
  AUTO startline,increment

DESCRIPTION
  AUTO enters automatic line entry mode.
  'startline' is the line number to start
  numbering at. 'increment' is the increment for
  each new line.

  Both are optional and default to 10 if the
  command has not previously been used or the
  state of the last used AUTO command when it was
  terminated.

  When in automatic line entry mode the next line
  number will be automatically generated and the
  cursor placed after it ready for a program line
  to be entered. When ENTER is pressed the line
  will be saved to memory and the next number
  generated.

  If the line number is the same as an existing
  line in memory it will be preceded by an
  asterisk(*). In this case pressing ENTER without
  entering any text will preserve the line in
  memory and generate the next number.
