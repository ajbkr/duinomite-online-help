NAME
  HELP -- DuinoMite Help File Version 2 (custom)

DESCRIPTION
  This helpfile is a work in progress and in time
  will be the main help file that users can store
  on the micro SD card and have a precise online
  help file with code examples to ensure a handy
  reference will always be available when needed.

  A new feature for the Duinomite is the addition
  of this new help system. One can add the
  following code to the AUTORUN.BAS file "OPTION
  F1 "help"+chr$(13)" then when F1 is pressed this
  help page will come up. The 'help' folder must
  be installed on the micro SD card (Drive B:).

  Due to the maximum length of a file name being 8
  characters, commands etc have abbreviated names
  to fit this convention. The file names in
  brackets () are the shortened names.

  One can bring up any files by simply doing help
  "whatever and the file will come on the screen
  and not interrupt the program one is working on.
  All file names are in lower case.

EXAMPLE
  \>help "pause   :-will clear the screen and show
   the "pause" command, then go back to the
   command prompt.

  The information in this help file system was
  taken from the MMBasic V2.7 PDF and the Olimex
  Duinomite V1.1 PDF. Many thanks for both of
  those resources used to create this help file
  system.
