NAME
  CANRCV -- the CANRCV command

SYNOPSIS
  CANRCV id, type, len, data(), ok

DESCRIPTION
  The CANRCV checks if a CAN message was received
  and is stored in the internal reception queue.

  Argument 'id' passes the message identifier and
  'type' the identifier type. A value of 0 means
  that it is a 11-bit STD identifier and a value
  of 1 means that it is a 29-bit EXT identifier. 

  The number of data bytes in the messages is
  passed by argument 'len'. 

  The actual message data is passed as a
  1-dimensional array, 'data'.

  Pass in a variable for argument 'ok' to
  determine if a messages was received. In this
  case 'ok' holds the value 1. If it holds the
  value 0 then either there was no message present
  in the reception queue or the connection with
  the CAN bus has not yet been opened (see command
  CANOPEN).

  100 DIM rxId : DIM rxType : DIM rxLen
  105 DIM rxData(8) : DIM rxOk
  110 CANOPEN 500000

  130 CANRCV rxId,rxType,rxLen,rxData(0),rxOk
  140 IF rxOk = 1 THEN
  150 PRINT "CAN message received"
