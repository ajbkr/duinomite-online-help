NAME
  CIRCLE -- the CIRCLE command

SYNOPSIS
  CIRCLE(x and y),r[,c[,F]]

  The circle is drawn on the video output centred
  at x and y with a radius of r. If c is zero the
  pixels are turned off if it is non zero or not
  specified the pixels are turned on (ie the
  circle is drawn). The F option will cause the
  circle to be filled according to the c 
  parameter.

  NOTE: As the pixels are not exactly square, the
  circle will be oval to some degree.

EXAMPLE
  \> CIRCLE(30,60),30,1,F

  This draws a circle starting at video screen
  coordinates x=30, y=60 turning on the pixels and
  then filling it to make a solid.
