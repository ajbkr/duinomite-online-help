NAME
  PIN -- the PIN function

DESCRIPTION
  The PIN(pin) function returns the value on the
  external I/O 'pin'. Zero means digital low, 1
  means digital high and for analog inputs it will
  return the measured voltage as a floating point
  number.

  Frequency inputs will return the frequency in Hz
  (maximum 200KHz) A period input will return the
  period in milliseconds while a count input will
  return the count since reset (counting is done
  on the rising edge). The count input can be
  reset to zero by resetting the pin to counting
  input (even if it is already so configured).

  'pin' zero is a special case which will always
  return the state of the bootload push button in
  the PC board (non zero means that the button is
  down).

  SETPIN, PIN() = commands. 

EXAMPLE
  \>10 SETPIN 1,8
  \>20 PIN(1) = PIN(0)
  \>30 GOTO 20

  The above program will cause a LED connected via
  a suitable current-limiting resistor to GPIO pin
  1 and GND to light ON when the User button is
  pressed.
