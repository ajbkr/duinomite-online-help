NAME
  OCT -- the OCT function

DESCRIPTION
  The OCT(number) function will return a string
  giving the octal (base 8) representation of
  'number'.

  'number' is rounded to an integer before
  OCT$(number) is evaluated. OCT$ converts decimal
  values within the range of ±1677100 to an octal
  string expression.

  Octal numbers are numbers in base 8 rather than
  base 10 (decimal numbers).

SEE ALSO
  HEX$().

EXAMPLE
