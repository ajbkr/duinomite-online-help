NAME
  SAVEBMP -- the SAVEBMP command

DESCRIPTION
  The SAVEBMP file$ command saves the current VGA
  or composite screen as a BMP file in the current
  working directory on the default drive. (The
  internal FLASH is drive A:, the micro SD card,
  if installed, is drive B:).

  If an extension is not specified, ".BMP" will be
  appended to the filename automatically.

EXAMPLE
  \> SAVEBMP "IMAGE.BMP"

  Note that Windows 7 Paint has trouble displaying
  the image. This appears to be a bug in Paint as
  all the software tested (including windows XP
  Paint) can display the image without fault.
