NAME
  INPUT$ -- the INPUT$ function

DESCRIPTION
  The INPUT$(nbr, [#]fnbr) function will return a
  string composed of 'nbr' characters read from a
  file previously opened for INPUT with the file
  number 'fnbr'. This function will read all
  characters including carriage returns and new
  lines without translation. The # is optional.

  When reading from a serial communications port
  this will return as many characters as are
  waiting in the receive buffer up to 'nbr'. If
  there are no characters waiting it will return
  immediately with an empty string. 

SEE ALSO
