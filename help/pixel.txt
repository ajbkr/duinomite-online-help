NAME
  PIXEL -- the PIXEL command

DESCRIPTION
  The PIXEL(x,y) = value command will set a pixel
  on a VGA or composite screen to off (if the
  value is zero) or on (if the value is non zero).

  See the function PIXEL(x,y) for obtaining the
  value of a pixel.

  Coordinates are specified in pixels. 'x' is a
  pixel on the horizontal axis and 'y' is a pixel
  on the vertical axis.

  The x and y axis start at the top left of the
  screen which is defined as location 0,0. The
  location of the bottom right of the screen is
  defined by the read-only variables MM.HRES (the
  horizontal x axis) and MM.VRES (the vertical y
  axis). These variables change depending on the
  selected video mode (VGA or composite). For a
  VGA screen, x=480 and y=432.

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 FOR x = 1 TO 80
  \> 20 FOR y = 1 TO 40
  \> 30 PIXEL(x,y)=1
  \> 40 NEXT x,y

  This program draws a solid rectangle at the top
  left of the screen.
