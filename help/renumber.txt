NAME
  RENUMBER -- the RENUMBER command

SYNOPSIS
  RENUMBER
  RENUMBER first
  RENUMBER first,incr
  RENUMBER first,incr,start

DESCRIPTION
  The RENUMBER command will renumber the program
  currently held in memory including all
  references to line numbers in commands such as
  GOTO, GOSUB, ON etc. 

  'first' is the number to be used in the new
  sequence. Default is 10. 

  'start' is the line number in the old program
  where renumbering should commence from. The
  default is the first line of the program.

  This command will first check for errors that
  may disrupt the renumbering process and it will
  only change the program in memory if no errors
  are found. However, it is prudent to save the
  program before running this command in case
  there are some errors that are not caught.
