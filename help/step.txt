NAME
  FOR -- the FOR command

DESCRIPTION
  The FOR counter = start TO finish [STEP
  increment] command will iniate a FOR-Next loop
  with the 'counter' initially set to 'start'
  and incrementing in 'increment' steps (default
  is 1) until 'counter' equals 'finish'. The
  'increment' must be an integer, but it may be a
  negative integer.

  The NEXT Command

  The NEXT [counter_variable][,counter-variable]
  ,etc command comes at the end of the
  FOR ... NEXT loop. The 'counter-variable'
  specifies exactly which loop is being operated
  on. If no 'counter-variable' is specified the
  NEXT will default to the innermost loop. It is
  also possible to specify multiple
  counter-variables as in NEXT x,y,z 

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 FOR I = 1 TO 3
  \> 20 PRINT I;
  \> 30 NEXT
  \> RUN
  1 2 3

  \> 10 FOR I = 1 TO 3 STEP 2
  \> 20 PRINT I;
  \> 30 NEXT
  \> RUN
  1 3
