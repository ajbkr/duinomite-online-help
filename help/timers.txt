NAME
  TIMER -- the TIMER function

DESCRIPTION
  The TIMER function returns the elapsed time in
  milliseconds (eg 1/1000 of a second) since
  reset. If not specifically reset this count will
  wrap around to zero after 49 days. 

  The timer is reset to zero on power up and you
  can also reset it by using TIMER as a command.
