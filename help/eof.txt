NAME
  EOF -- the EOF function

DESCRIPTION
  The EOF([#]nbr) function will return true if the
  file previously opened for INPUT with the file
  number 'nbr' is positioned at the end of the
  file.

  If used on a file number opened as a serial port
  this function will return true if there are no
  characters waiting in the receive buffer.

  The # is optional.

  Open the COM1 serial port and if a character is
  received in the buffer print it.
