NAME
 IF -- the IF command

DESCRIPTION
  The IF expr THEN statemnet or IF expr THEN
  statement ELSE statement, evaulates the "expr"
  and performs the THEN statement if it is true
  or skips to the next line if false.

  The optional ELSE statement is the reverse of
  the THEN test. The 'statement' can be just a
  line number and in that case a GOTO is assumed.
  For Microsoft BASIC compatability the THEN
  "statement" construct can be also replaced with
  a "GOTO" line number.

  This type of IF statement is all on one line.

  The IF expression THEN

  <statement>
  [ELSE
  <statements>]
  [ELSEIF expression THEN
  <statements>]
  ENDIF

  Multiline IF statement with optional ELSE and
  ELSEIF cases and ending with ENDIF. Each
  component is on a seperate line. The IF
  evaluates "expression" and performs the
  statement(s) following THEN if the "expression"
  is true or optionally the statement(s) following
  the ELSE statements as required.

  The ELSE statement

  The ELSE statement introduces a default
  condition in a multiline IF statement.

  The ELSEIF expression THEN statement

  Introduces a secondary condition in a multiline
  IF statement.

  The ENDIF statement

  Terminates a multiline IF statement.
