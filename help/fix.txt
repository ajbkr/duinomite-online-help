NAME
  FIX -- the FIX function

DESCRIPTION
  The FIX(nbr) function will truncate nbr to a
  whole number by eliminating the decimal point
  and all characters to the right of the decimal
  point.

  The major difference between FIX ans INT is that
  FIX provides a true integer function (ie does
  not return the next lower number for negative
  numbers as INT() does).

  This behaviour is for Microsoft compatibility.  

SEE ALSO
  CINT, INT

EXAMPLE
  \> PRINT FIX(-9.1)
  -9
