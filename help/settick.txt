NAME
  SETTICK -- the SETTICK command

DESCRIPTION
  The SETTICK period,line command sets up a
  periodic interrupt (or tick). The time between
  interrupts is 'period' milliseconds and 'line'
  is the line number of the interrupt routine. The
  period can range from 1 to 4294967295 mSec
  (about 49 days). The interrupt can be disabled
  by setting 'line' to zero (ie: SETTICK 0,0).

  \> 90 IRETURN
