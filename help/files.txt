NAME
  FILES -- the FILES command

DESCRIPTION
  The FILES [search_pattern$] command will list
  files in the current directory of the default
  drive.

  The micro SD card (drive B:) may use an optional
  'search_pattern$'.

  A question mark(?) matches any character and an
  asterisk(*) as the first character of the
  filename or extension will match any file or any
  extension. 

  If the search_pattern$ is omitted, all files
  will be listed.
