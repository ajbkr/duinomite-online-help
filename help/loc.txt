NAME
  LOC -- the LOC function

DESCRIPTION
  The LOC([#]nbr) function will return the number
  of bytes waiting in the receive buffer of a
  serial port (ie: COM1: or COM:2) that has been
  opened as #nbr.

  The # is optional.

  'nbr' is the file number used when the serial
  port was opened. When transmitting or receiving
  a file through a communication port, LOC returns
  the number of characters in the input buffer
  waiting to be read. The default size for the
  input buffer is 127 characters. 

  If there are more than 127 characters received
  only the last 127 remain in the buffer, LOC
  returns 127. 

  If fewer than 127 characters remain in the
  buffer, then LOC returns the actual count.

EXAMPLE
  \> 20 IF LOC(#1) = 5 THEN 300

  The program branches to line 300 after 5
  characters are read.
