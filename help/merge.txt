NAME
  MERGE -- the MERGE command

DESCRIPTION
  The MERGE file$ command adds program lines from
  'file$' to the program in memory. Unlike LOAD,
  it does not clear the program currently in
  memory.

  Note that the line numbers of the merged program
  lines will replace those of the already loaded
  program if they conflict.

EXAMPLE
  \> LIST
  10 REM Test program 1
  20 FOR I = 1 TO 20
  30 PRINT I
  40 NEXT I
  \> MERGE "TEST2.BAS"
  \> LIST
  10 REM Test program 2
  20 FOR I = 1 TO 20
  30 PRINT I
  40 NEXT I
  50 GOTO 20

  TEST2.BAS contained just a new line 10 which has
  now overwritten the original test program's
  existing line 10 and a new line 50.
