NAME
  LINE INPUT --	the LINE INPUT command

SYNOPSIS
  LINE INPUT [prompt$] string-variable$

  This command reads the entire line from the
  keyboard into 'string-variable$'. The optional
  'prompt$' will be printed first. Unlike INPUT,
  LINE INPUT will read a whole line, not stopping
  for comma delimited data items.

  A question mark is not printed unless it is part
  of "prompt$".

  LINE INPUT #nbr,string-variable$

  This command is the same as the previous one
  except that the input is read from a file
  previously opened for INPUT as 'nbr'.

SEE ALSO
  OPEN, INPUT.

EXAMPLE
  \> 10 OPEN "OUT1.TXT" FOR input AS #1
  \> 20 LINE INPUT#1, A$
  \> 30 PRINT "Text: " A$
  \> 40 CLOSE#1
