NAME
  CANOPEN, CANCLOSE -- the CANOPEN and CANCLOSE
                       commands

SYNOPSIS
  CANOPEN speed
  CANCLOSE
	
DESCRIPTION
  The CANOPEN command configures the CAN
  controller for the specified communication speed
  and synchronizes to the CAN bus. The message
  reception acceptance filter is configured to
  receive all valid CAN message identifiers, both
  11-bit STD (0..7FFh) and 29-bit EXT
  (0..1FFFFFFF). The communication speed should be
  in the range 10 kbps to 1 Mbps.
	
  The CANCLOSE command closes the connection with
  the CAN bus by placing the CAN controller back
  into its configuration mode.
