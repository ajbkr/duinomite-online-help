NAME
  LOOP -- the DO ... LOOP, DO ... LOOP WHILE,
   and DO ... LOOP UNTIL commands

DESCRIPTION
  The DO ... LOOP Command

  This structure will loop forever or until an
  EXIT command terminates the loop or control is
  explicitly transferred outside of the loop with
  commands like GOTO and RETURN. 

  Note: The DO keyword must be on a line by
  itself.

  The DO ... LOOP WHILE Command

  The DO WHILE LOOP command loops while the
  conditions are true. The conditonss must be
  numeric expressions. If they evaluate to zero
  they are treated as false; non-zero is treated
  as true.

  Note: The DO keyword must be on a line by
  itself.

  (This is equivalent to the deprecated
  WHILE ... WEND loop, also implemented in
  MMBasic.)

  The DO ... LOOP UNTIL Command

  The DO ... LOOP UNTIL command will loop until
  the conditional expression following the UNTIL
  is true.

  Note: The DO keyword must be on a line by
  itself.

EXAMPLES
  \> 10 DO
  \> 20 PRINT "Hello world" 
  \> 30 I = I + 1
  \> 40 IF I >= 4 THEN END
  \> 50 LOOP

  \> 10 DO
  \> 20 I = I + 1
  \> 30 PRINT I
  \> 40 LOOP WHILE I < 5

  \> 10 DO
  \> 20 I = I + 1
  \> 30 PRINT I
  \> 40 LOOP UNTIL I = 5
