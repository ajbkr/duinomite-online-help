NAME
  RUN -- the RUN command

DESCRIPTION
  The RUN [line|file$] command will execute the
  program in memory. If a line number is supplied,
  then excucution begins at that line. Or, if a
  filename (file$) in quotation marks is supplied,
  the current program will be erased and that
  program will be loaded from the default drive
  and executed. This enables one program to load
  and run another.

  If an extension is not specified, '.BAS' will be
  appended to the filename. You can also omit the
  trailing quotation mark.

  Note: You cannot specify a line number AND a
  filename.
