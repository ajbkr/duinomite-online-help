DESCRIPTION
  The FONT command will select a font for the
  video output.

  'nbr' is the font number in the range 1 to 10,
  the # symbol is optional.

  'scale' is the scaling factor in the range 1 to
  8 (eg a scale of 2 will double the size of
  pixels in both the vertical and horizontal).
  Default is 1.

  If 'reverse' is a number other than zero, the
  font will be displayed in reverse video. Default
  is no reverse.

  There are three fonts built in to MMBasic.

  #1 is the standard font of 10x5 pixels
  containing the full ASCII set.
	
  #2 is a larger font of 16x11 pixels also with
  the full ASCII set.

  #3 is a jumbo font of 30x22 pixels consisting of
  the numbers zero to nine and the characters
  plus,minus,comma and fullstop.

  The FONT LOAD Command

  The FONT LOAD file$ AS [#]nbr will load the font
  contained in "file$" and install it as font
  'nbr' which can be any number between 4 and 10,
  the # symbol is optional.

  The FONT LOADB Command

  FONT LOADB fname$ as #nbr

  The FONT LOADB file$ AS [#]nbr will load VGA
  Binary font contained in "file$" and install it
  as font 'nbr' which can be any number between 4
  and 10, the # symbol is optional. It will assume
  8bits wide fonts.

  The FONT UNLOAD Command

  The FONT UNLOAD[#]nbr will unload font 'nbr' and
  free its memory. The # symbol is optional. You
  cannot unload the builtin fonts.
