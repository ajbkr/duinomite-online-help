NAME
  CANSEND -- the CANSEND command
	
SYNOPSIS
  CANSEND id, type, len, data(), ok	

DESCRIPTION
  The CANSEND places a CAN messages in the
  transmit queue and the moment a CAN transmit
  message slot becomes available, the CAN message
  sends onto the CAN bus. 
	
  Argument 'id' sets the message identifier and
  'type' the identifier type.
	
  Set 'type' to 0 for a 11-bit STD message
  identifier (most common). Or set 'type' to 1 for
  a 29-bit EXT message identifier. 
	
  The number of data bytes in the messages is set
  by argument 'len'. This can be anywhere in the
  range 1..8. 
	
  The actual message data is passed as a
  1-dimensional array called 'data'.
	
  Pass in a variable for argument 'ok' to
  determine if the message transmission was
  successful. In this case 'ok' holds the value 1.
  If it holds the value 0 then either the transmit
  queue is full so you can try a little later
  again or the connection with the CAN bus has not
  yet been opened (see command CANOPEN).
	
EXAMPLE
  100 DIM txData(2) : DIM txOk
  110 CANOPEN 500000
  120 txData(0) = &H55
  130 txData(1) = &HAA
  140 CANSEND &H123,0,2,txData(0),txOk
  150 IF txOk = 0 THEN PRINT "Could not send CAN message"
  160 CANCLOSE
